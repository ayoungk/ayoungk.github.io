### I am currently working as an associate professor in the department mechanical engineering at Seoul National University (SNU). Before joining SNU, I was at the civil and environmental engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I have the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from SNU in 2005 and 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor, in 2011 and 2012.
