## Research
I am leadning Robust Perception for Mobile robotics lab ([RPM Robotics Lab](https://rpm.snu.ac.kr/)) at Seoul National University (SNU). My research interest is perceptual robot autonomy for navigation and spatial representation learning.

## Bio
I am currently working as an associate professor in the department [mechanical engineering](https://me.snu.ac.kr/) at SNU since 2021 Sep. Before joining SNU, I was at the [civil and environmental engineering](https://civil.kaist.ac.kr/), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) from 2014 to 2021. I have the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from SNU in 2005 and 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor, in 2011 and 2012.
